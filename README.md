# Disease-Prediction-and-Drug-Recommendationn-Application

## Problem Statement

***In this digital world, most of the people are prone to diseases, due to lack of healthy food,
proper sleep and daily exercise. It is very crucial to know if we are suffering from a disease, at
an early stage rather than discovering it at a later stage. However for consulting a doctor
offline it is very cost effective and time consuming process and even for a little issue which
can be resolved just by little bit search or knowledge in which doctor is not required also being
a problem due to lack of knowledge.
Hence project aims to develop a web application for disease prediction system as it predicts
the diseases based on symptoms. This disease prediction system uses Machine Learning
algorithm named Na√Øve Bayes. This system also suggests drugs that are most commonly
used to cure the disease. And also if needed this application helps to appoint a doctorfor
better convenience and satisfaction.***

## Project Motive

* Technology, now a days helped in various aspects of life. Healthcare/Hospitality is one of the growing field in case of data science and data mining process.
* As the pandamic going on most of the people suffer the fear of having a corona virus if any mildsymptoms arises. Due to this they eirher don't took any medicine or kept themselves locked in the house.
* From these things I get an idea to develop a disease recommmendation system in order to predict the dicease based on the symptoms and recommend the drug based on the prediction from the application .

## App Feature
* Two way login authenctication one for Patient dashboard and other for doctor dashboard.
* Patient can predict the disease based on the symptoms.
* Patient can book an appointment with the doctor.
* Doctor can reccomend the medcine based on prediction.
* Responsive Design to give better user experience.
